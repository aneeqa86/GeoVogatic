GeoVogatic. 

GeoVogatic is an app structure  helping you customize your geojson/ gml files of layers to your preferred colours, sizes, and transparency. 

To use GeoVogatic app: 
1.	Please download all associated files (Html, Javascript, CSS, images). 
2.	Open the HTML file into a notepad++ or any suitable notepad.
3.	Run the code into any web browser. 
4. Drag and Drop a proper GeoJson File to the map. (So far only Geojson files can be implemented)

GeoVogatic is still an on-going project, and until is it complete, we do not guarantee a full and functional code at the time of your use.
